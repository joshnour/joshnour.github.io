                <p>Hi, I'm Josh, a (Software) Engineer.</p>
                <p>
                    I went to the University of Pennsylvania and graduated Summa Cum Laude with a BSE in
                    Computer Science and an MSE in Data Science in 2022.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spent over a year at Amazon before attending a two-year analytical fellowship which I have recently
                    returned from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Iâ€™m currently open to full-time opportunities in the NYC area. Feel free to reach out!
